  Volcanic Rocks (GLY 431) - Traveling Volcanology Field Course from the State 
  University of New York at Buffalo 
    In this course I was taken to 2 field sites unknown to me and had to deduce their geological history through                observations I made while there
    Engaged in volcanic field work at Zuni Salt Lake in New Mexico, a maar volcano, and in Peach Spring Tuff deposits in        Kingman, Arizona
    Took detailed geological notes and observations about deposits
    Created 2 detailed stratigraphic columns at each site in order to construct a depositional timeline and a geological        report on the study area.
